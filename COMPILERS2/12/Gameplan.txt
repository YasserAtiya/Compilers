Search through block for register to register copy
   Iterate through block,
      if we have a move instruction,
         take its sets and uses and places them in two separate varstates
   Loop through rest of block, and see if we used found uses varstate, if so replace wiht found set varstate
         If regexists in line's uses,
            minus found uses from it,
            union found set varstate with current line uses


Loop through every line in program
   Pick up sets
   Check uses
      On every use, subtract the uses from our varstate
      On every set, if that reg/var is in our varstate
         Call function to go backwards from line until reg/var assignment is found, then delete that line
