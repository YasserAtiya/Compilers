Gameplan Live Variable Analysis.
   Find Defs and uses
      Go from first line down
         Find defs
            Difference uses of block wth sets of line
               Union with defs of block
         Find uses
            Get number of uses in line
            use varcommon(cblk->defs,curline->uses)
               If that returns number of uses in line, they are not uses
                  otherwise subtract block from line set, and union that with block's uses
   Use sets and uses to find ins and outs
      Use algorithm

   Find Dead
      Difference ins and outs to find variables that die inside
         When a variable or register is used that is on the will die list, search through other instructions to see if it is used again
            If not, dead
